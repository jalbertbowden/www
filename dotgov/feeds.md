[Only Vulnerabilities Which Have Been Analyzed Within the Previous Eight Dats - NVD (National Vulnerability Database)](https://nvd.nist.gov/download/nvd-rss-analyzed.xml) ## RSS Vulnerability Feeds

NVD provides two RSS 1.0 data feeds. The first feed, [nvd-rss.xml](https://nvd.nist.gov/download/nvd-rss.xml) ([zip](https://nvd.nist.gov/download/nvd-rss.xml.zip) or [gz](https://nvd.nist.gov/download/nvd-rss.xml.gz)), provides information on all vulnerabilities within the previous eight days. The second feed, [nvd-rss-analyzed.xml](https://nvd.nist.gov/download/nvd-rss-analyzed.xml) ([zip](https://nvd.nist.gov/download/nvd-rss-analyzed.xml.zip) or [gz](https://nvd.nist.gov/download/nvd-rss-analyzed.xml.gz)), provides only vulnerabilities which have been analyzed within the previous eight days. The advantage of the second feed is that we are able to provide vulnerable product names in the title. The advantage of the former is that you learn about new vulnerabilities as soon as possible.
