## Geocoding  

Geocoding is the assignment of a code – usually numeric -- to a geographic location. (So, one geocode that you’re probably already familiar with is your ZIPcode.) Usually however, when someone talks about geocoding, they are talking about geocodes that are a bit more specific, i.e., affixing to an individual address its latitude and longitude – which is, very simply, the vertical and horizontal distance of a point relative to the equator2. Once the latitude and longitude are known, you can then figure out all sorts of other geocodes to affix by determining what geographic regions the specified point lies in, e.g., what ZIPcode does this point lie in? What census tract? What census blockgroup? What police precinct? Appending any of these codes to a specific street address is considered geocoding.

## GIS  

GIS – Geographical Information Systems – are technology based systems that combine layers of geographic data to give you a better understanding of a particular place1. For example, you might combine a layer of cholera outbreaks with a layer of water sources to be able to display graphically the relationship between the two.

[Geographic Areas Reference Manual - GARM](http://www.census.gov/geo/reference/garm.html)  
The Geographic Areas Reference Manual (GARM) describes in great detail the basic geographic entities the Census Bureau used in its various data tabulations for the 1990 Census and documents the purposes, definitions, standards, criteria, and procedures used to select, define, delineate, and revise those geographic entities.  
After the publication of the GARM in November 1994, there were two major changes in geographic areas for Census 2000:  
The Census Bureau no longer includes the Republic of Palau in U. S. censuses because it became an independent state on October 1, 1994.
All entities referred to as "block numbering areas" (BNAs) in 1990 became census tracts.
