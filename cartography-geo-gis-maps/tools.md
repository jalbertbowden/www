## [Map Glyphs - The Ultimate CSS Map Font](http://mapglyphs.com/)  
Map Glpyhs has hundreds of scalable vector map icons of this world, continent, globes, countries, and states. 


## [TileMill](http://www.somebits.com/weblog/tech/good/tilemill.html)  
TileMill is a turnkey system for designing custom slippy maps for the web. TileMill comes with Natural Earth data baked in and allows you to design in the browser. TileMill is styled with [Carto](https://github.com/mapbox/carto), a CSS-like language, and provides a code editor and live view of generated tiles.

## [Carto: Fast CSS-Like Map Style Sheets](https://github.com/mapbox/carto#readme)  
CartoCSS is the language for map design used by [Mapbox Studio Classic](http://mapbox.com/mapbox-studio-classic/). It is similar in syntax to CSS, but builds upon it with specific abilities to filter map data and by providing things like variables.  
Carto, aka CartoCSS, targets the [Mapnik renderer](http://mapnik.org/) and is able to generate Mapnik XML.  
Carto is an evolution of the [Cascadenik](https://github.com/mapnik/Cascadenik) idea and language, with an emphasis on speed and flexibility. If you are a previous user of Cascadenik, see the [key differences wiki](https://github.com/mapbox/carto/wiki/Differences-With-Cascadenik).  

## [zipdecode-js](https://github.com/NelsonMinar/zipdecode-js)
