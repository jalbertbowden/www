is there any connected functionality between the two charts?
  like, if i do X, do you expect something from chart a and b?

the regions input boxes
  do they do anything besides show a regions name/highlight regional data when interacted with?
  so i guess, functionality...

what is going on in the left hand column, underneath the input box labelled united states?
  i'm assuming that is the number of countries in the select box?


in the bottom chart
  why are two lines highlighted
  why are two countries highlighted on right
  why don't their numbers match the numbers on the y-axis
  why are the two tooltips highlighted?

looks like first chart starts at 2002 and the second one starts at 2003....is that correct?

How will the alternate Y Axis labels work?
  do the end points of the last year (2017) line up with country names?
