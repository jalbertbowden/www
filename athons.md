An X-athon is a "hackathon" for metadata clustered around a specific cultural entity such as a person or work. A group of cataloguers and others get together to "hack" data conforming to the guidelines and instructions of RDA: Resource Description and Access.

The data are created, imported, edited, exported, and otherwise manipulated using RIMMF, the RDA editor.

The data are formatted for RIMMF as RIMMF-balls and for Semantic Web linked data as RDF-balls.
