## [USGS EarthExplorer](http://edcsns17.cr.usgs.gov/EarthExplorer)

## [USGS 1:100,000-Scale Digital Line Graphs](http://mcmcweb.er.usgs.gov/status/dlg_stat.html)  
The 1:100,000-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) data files are digital representations of cartographic information. Data files of topographic and planimetric map features are derived from cartographic source materials using manual and automated digitizing methods. DLG files are distributed in three ways: over an anonymous ftp account (hydrography and transportation only), on CD-ROM, and on magnetic tape.   

## [Shuttle Radar Topography Mission](ftp://edcsgs9.cr.usgs.gov/pub/data/srtm)  
Three-dimensional images and animations generated from high-resolution (30-m) data acquired during the February 2000 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM).  The site will ultimately contain topographic data of the entire world.
[From a JPL site(http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/pub_dist.htm):  "SRTM data for a number of sites within the United States are now available for download via File Transfer Protocol (ftp). Users should be aware that these data are intended for use with Geographic Information System (GIS) or other special application software, and are not directly viewable in a browser. Various types of visualizations (perpectives, stereo pairs, anaglyphs, etc.) generated using these data are available from the main page. Also, users should be aware that the digital elevation maps and images are unedited and are intended for scientific use and evaluation. They are outputs directly from the SRTM interferometric radar processor, and for example may contain numerous voids (areas without data), water bodies may not appear flat, and coastlines may be ill-defined."  

## [USGS Land Use and Land Cover Data](http://edc.usgs.gov/doc/edchome/ndcdb/ndcdb.html)  
The Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) data files describe the vegetation, water, natural surface, and cultural features on the land surface. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) provides these datasets and associated maps as a part of its National Mapping Program. The LULC mapping program is designed so that standard topographic maps of a scale of 1:250,000 can be used for compilation and organization of the land use and land cover data. In some cases, such as Hawai'i, 1:100,000-scale maps are also used.  
The LULC data are available (at no cost) through an Internet anonymous ftp account at the EDC. The data are also available (at cost of reproduction) on magnetic tape from the USGS's Earth Science Information Centers.   

## [USGS Digital Elevation Model (DEM) Data](http://edc.usgs.gov/doc/edchome/ndcdb/ndcdb.html)  
A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) consists of a sampled array of elevations for ground positions that are normally at regularly spaced intervals. The 1-degree DEM (3-by-3 arc-second data spacing) provides coverage in 1-by-1 degree blocks for all of the contiguous U.S., Hawai'i, and limited portions of Alaska. The basic elevation model is produced by or for the Defense Mapping Agency (DMA), but is distributed by the USGS's EROS Data Center in the DEM data record format. In reformatting the product, the USGS does not change the basic elevation information. The 1-degree DEMs are also referred to as "3-arc second" or "1:250,000-scale" DEM data.  

## [Digital Chart of the World Derived DEM Data](http://edcdaac.usgs.gov/gtopo30/gtopo30.html)  
A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) consists of a sampled array of elevations for ground positions that are normally at regularly spaced intervals. The Digital Chart of the World (DCW) DEM data provide 30-by-30 arc-second digital elevation data produced from the Defense Mapping Agency's (DMA) 1:1,000,000-scale DCW contour and hydrology data.

## [Gridded Population of the World (GPW)](http://infoserver.ciesin.org/datasets/gpw/globldem.doc.html)  
Demographic information is usually provided on a national basis, even though countries are always changing. As an alternate scheme, one might use ecological zones rather than nation states. There is, however, no agreement as to what these zones should be. By way of contrast, global environmental studies using satellites as collection devices yield results indexed by latitude and longitude. Thus, it makes sense to assemble the terrestrial arrangement of people in a compatible manner. This alternative is explored here, using latitude/longitude quadrilaterals as bins for population information. This data format also has considerable advantage for analytical studies. There are four files in this dataset. Each file contains one variable. The variables are:  
population counts, unsmoothed  
file name gpxxx or countrawxxx  
population density, unsmoothed  
file name gppdxxx or densrawxxx  
global population (counts, smoothed)  
file name gppycxxx or countsmooxxx  
global population (population density, smoothed)  
file name gppycpdxxx or denssmooxxx  
For most countries, data were available from the 1980s or early 1990s. The data are available as ASCII files or as pkzip compressed ArcInfo Export files. The ArcInfo Export files are in three formats:  
     ArcInfo GRID, 0.083 x 0.083-degree cell size (GRIDDD)
     ArcInfo GRID, 5 x 5-minute cell size (GRIDDM)
     ArcInfo polygon format, created from GRIDDM (POLYDM)

## [USGS Modern Average Global Sea-Surface Temperature](http://geochange.er.usgs.gov/pub/magsst/magsst.html)  
The purpose of this dataset is to provide paleoclimate researchers with a tool for estimating the average seasonal variation in sea-surface temperature (SST) throughout the modern world ocean and for estimating the modern monthly and weekly sea-surface temperature at any given oceanic location. It is expected that these data will be compared with temperature estimates derived from geological proxy measures such as faunal census analyses and stable isotopic analyses. The results can then be used to constrain general circulation models
of climate change.  
The data contained in this dataset are derived from the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer Multichannel Sea Surface Temperature data (AVHRR MCSST), which are obtainable from the Distributed Active Archive Center at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, CA. The JPL tapes contain weekly images of SST from October 1981 through December 1990 in nine regions of the world ocean: North Atlantic, Eastern North Atlantic, South Atlantic, Agulhas, Indian, Southeast Pacific, Southwest Pacific, Northeast Pacific, and Northwest Pacific.  

## [ESRI Public Geographic Data Sets](http://www.esri.com/data/index.html)

## [World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE)](http://woce.nodc.noaa.gov/wdiu)  
The WOCE Data Management System is decentralized, with centers located at research institutions and national data centers in a number of participating WOCE countries. The purpose of the decentralization is to ensure the direct involvement of research groups in the management of WOCE datasets, thus ensuring data quality.
The system consists of centers linked in a national and international network:  
      WOCE Data Assembly Centers (DACs) handle assembly and quality control of datasets 
     Hydrographic Data
     Sea Level Data
     Sub-Surface Float Data
     Surface Drifter Data
     Current Meter Data
     Upper Ocean Thermal Data (XBT/XCTD Sections)
     Satellite Data
     Surface Meteorological Data
     Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) Data
     Bathymetric Data
     Sea Surface Salinity Data  
      WOCE Special Analysis Centers (SACs) perform data analysis and synthesis functions, including the generation of derived datasets and products 
     Hydrographic Data  

      The Data Information Unit (DIU) provides a source of information on the status of WOCE by tracking WOCE data collection, processing, and archiving activities World Data Centers (WDCs) serve as the permanent archive for the data from WOCE  

## [SeaWiFS Project](http://seawifs.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEAWIFS.html)  
The purpose of the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) Project is to provide quantitative data on global ocean bio-optical properties to the Earth science community. Subtle changes in ocean color signify various types and quantities of marine phytoplankton (microscopic marine plants), the knowledge of which has both scientific and practical applications. The SeaWiFS Project develops and operates a research data system that processes, calibrates, validates, archives, and distributes data received from an Earth-orbiting ocean color sensor. A detailed description of the objectives, organization and operations, as well as the current status of the SeaWiFS Project, is available.  
[Nimbus-7 Coastal Zone Color Scanner data (1978 - 1986) are available](http://seawifs.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEAWIFS/IMAGES/CZCS_DATA.html) from the following geographical regions:
