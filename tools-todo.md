FFFFallback, a handy tool that allows you to find the best font stack that will degrade gracefully. The tool comes in a form of a bookmarklet, which will analyze the font family on your page and suggest a set of fonts to use as fallback.  

[Typeplate](http://typeplate.com/)  
Typeplate is a “typographic starter kit”. We don’t make aesthetic design choices, but define proper markup with extensible styling for common typographic patterns. A stripped-down Sass or CSS library of your choosing primarily concerned with the appropriate technical implementation of design patterns—not how they look.
