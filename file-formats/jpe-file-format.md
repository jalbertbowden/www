# JPE File Format

An optional extension used for JPEG files. Some Sony cameras have an option for simultaneously recording a low-res file for e-mail attachments that is saved as a .JPE along with the high-res .JPG file. Some Minolta cameras use the .JPE extension for images that contain embedded color profiles, and .JPG for ones that do not. Most image editors treat .JPE files as ordinary JPEGs, while other applications do not recognize the file type at all.
