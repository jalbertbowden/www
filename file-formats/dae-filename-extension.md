# .dae Digital Asset Exchange Filename Extension for COLLADA Interchange File Format  
COLLADA (COLLAborative Design Activity) is an interchange file format for interactive 3D applications. COLLADA is managed by the Khronos Group and has been adopted by ISO as a publicly available specification.  
COLLADA defines an open standard XML schema for exchanging digital assets amount various graphics software applications that might otherwise store their assets in incompatible file formats. COLLADA documents that describe digital assets are XML files, usually identified with a .dae (digital asset exchange) filename extension.

# COLLADA  
## 3D Asset Exchange Schema
COLLADA™ defines an XML-based schema to make it easy to transport 3D assets between applications - enabling diverse 3D authoring and content processing tools to be combined into a production pipeline. The intermediate language provides comprehensive encoding of visual scenes including: geometry, shaders and effects, physics, animation, kinematics, and even multiple version representations of the same asset.COLLADA FX enables leading 3D authoring tools to work effectively together to create shader and effects applications and assets to be authored and packaged using OpenGL® Shading Language, Cg, CgFX, and DirectX® FX.  

## COLLADA at a glance  
COLLADA defines an XML Namespace and database schema to make it easy to transport 3D assets between applications without loss of information, enabling diverse 3D authoring and processing tools to be combined into a content production pipeline.
