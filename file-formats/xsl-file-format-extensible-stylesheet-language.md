# XSL - eXtensible Stylesheet Language  

XSL is a family of recommendations for defining XML document transformation and presentation. XSL consists of three parts:  
XSLT - XSL Transformations - a language for transforming XML.  
XPath - XML Path Language - an expression language used by XSLT (and many other languages) to access or refer to parts of an XML document.  
XSL-FO - XSL Formatting Objects - an XML vocabulary for specifying formatting semantics.  
An XSLT stylesheet specifies the presentation of a class of XML documents by describing how an instance of the class is transformed into an XML document that uses a formatting vocabulary, such as (X)HTML or XSL-FO. For a more detailed explanation of how XSL works, see the What Is XSL page.  
[The eXensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) Family](https://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/)  

eXtensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) is used to refer to a family of languages used to transform and render XML documents.  
Historically, the XSL Working Group in W3C produced a draft specification under the name XSL, which eventually split into three parts:

XSL Transformation (XSLT): an XML language for transforming XML documents
XSL Formatting Objects (XSL-FO): an XML language for specifying the visual formatting of an XML document
XML Path Language (XPath): a non-XML language used by XSLT, and also available for use in non-XSLT contexts, for addressing the parts of an XML document.
As a result, the term XSL is now used with a number of different meanings:

Sometimes it refers to XSLT: this usage is best avoided. However, "xsl" is used both as the conventional namespace prefix for the XSLT namespace, and as the conventional filename suffix for files containing XSLT stylesheet modules
Sometimes it refers to XSL-FO: this usage can be justified by the fact that the XSL-FO specification carries the title Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL); however, the term XSL-FO is less likely to be misunderstood
Sometimes it refers to both languages considered together, or to the working group that develops both languages
Sometimes, especially in the Microsoft world, it refers to a now-obsolete variant of XSLT developed and shipped by Microsoft as part of MSXML before the W3C specification was finalized
This article is concerned with the various usages of the term XSL: for details of the various languages embraced by the term, see the relevant article.

XSL is to XML as CSS is to HTML; XSL is essentially more sophisticated CSS.  
[Introduction to XSL](http://www.xmlfiles.com/xsl/xsl_intro.asp)  


XSL is a language for expressing style sheets. An XSL style sheet is, like with CSS, a file that describes how to display an XML document of a given type. XSL shares the functionality and is compatible with CSS2 (although it uses a different syntax)/ It also adds:  
A transformation language for XML documents: XSLT. Originally intended to perform complex styling operations, like the generation of tables of contents and indexes, it is now a general purpose XML processing language. XSLT is thus widely used for purposes other than XSL, like generating HTML web pages from XML data.
Advanced styling features, expressed by an XML document type which defines a set of elements called Formatting Objects, and attributes (in part borrowed from CSS2 properties) and adding more complex ones.
