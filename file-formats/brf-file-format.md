# .brf Braille File Extension  

Braille (.brf) Files  
The IRS provides .brf files formatted for printing through a Braille embosser to assist taxpayers who are visually impaired or blind. Sending these files to an embosser will produce a Braille version of the form or publication. Taxpayers cannot submit .brf files or hard copy Braille to the IRS, but they provide valuable tax information in Braille format.
