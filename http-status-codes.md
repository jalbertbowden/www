# HTTP Status Codes  

When accessing a web server or application, every HTTP request that is received by a server is responded to with an HTTP status code. HTTP status codes are three-digit codes, and are grouped into five different classes. The class of a status code can be quickly identified by its first digit:

1xx: Informational
2xx: Success
3xx: Redirection
4xx: Client Error
5xx: Server Error
