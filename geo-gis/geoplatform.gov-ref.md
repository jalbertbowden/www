[GeoPlatform.gov](https://www.geoplatform.gov/) was created to enhance geospatial resource sharing across the U.S. Government and the world, and to allow users like you to participate in an online geospatial services experience. Whether you want to discover and use up-to-date National Geospatial Data Assets (NGDAs), make a shared gallery of maps for your website, integrate quality National data into your web applications, or more, GeoPlatform.gov is a place to stay connected to a fast evolving geospatial service ecosystem.
[About GeoPlatform.gov](https://www.geoplatform.gov/about-geoplatform/)    

Implementation of the GeoPlatform embodies the principles and spirit of Open Government, emphasizing government-to-citizen communication, accountability, and transparency. The GeoPlatform supports open formats, data standards, and common core and extensible metadata. The portfolio of data, applications, and services provided here is stewarded through the use of open licenses and careful review and hosted on an infrastructure that maximizes interoperability. Increased sharing and reuse of resources facilitated by the GeoPlatform will reduce costs, result in savings and wise investments, and stimulate innovation and entrepreneurship. On balance, the integrated approach of the GeoPlatform means that the federal portfolio of geospatial data is better managed, serves a broader audience, and is easier to use.  

The GeoPlatform was developed by the member agencies of the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) through collaboration with partners and stakeholders. The target audience for the GeoPlatform includes Federal agencies, State, local, and Tribal governments, private sector, academia, and the general public.
