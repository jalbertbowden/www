# Datums/Geodetic Datums/Projections

The National Geodetic Survey has released updated models for transforming heights between ellipsoidal coordinates and physical height systems that relate to water flow. These models cover regions including the conterminous United States (CONUS), Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. GEOID12B transforms to NAVD 88 in CONUS and Alaska and to the respective datums for all the other regions (each having its own datum point). Models for the Deflection of the Vertical have also been released for these same regions mainly for aid in navigation systems.

The North American Datum (NAD is the datum now used to define the geodetic network in North America. A datum is a formal description of the shape of the Earth along with an "anchor" point for the coordinate system. In surveying, cartography, and land-use planning, two North American datums are in use: the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD 27) and the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Both are geodetic reference systems based on slightly different assumptions and measurements.

Use NADCON (North American Datum Conversion) to convert latitude and longitude from NAD 27 to NAD 83 or from NAD 83 to NAD 27.
