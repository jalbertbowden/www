Includes, for example, information about: human population size, composition (for example: age, sex, gender), distribution, mobility, educational attainment, employment status, income, and morbidity. Demographic trends describe population changes over time (for example: growth through migration and births, loss through mortality and emigration).

[ECON]

Economy

Information about the economic factors that determine how the members of a population support themselves and their resulting standard of living.  Includes, for example, information about: how geographic regions and social groups differ in economic factors or livelihoods; what social groups control or influence economic standards; and the major industries, key facilities, economic markets and their associated supply chains.
