A typical shared services initiative takes advantage of enterprise applications and other technological developments, enabling the company to achieve additional improvements in quality to processes, such as finance, accounting, procurement, information technology (IT), and human resources. At the core of shared services is the idea that new technologies offer businesses the opportunity to (1) make better use of scarce skills, (2) provide information and services more efficiently, and (3) reduce the cost of administration.
