The Census Bureau is the lead federal agency for the Governmental Units Theme. OMB Circular A-16
Revised defines a theme as representations of conceptual topics describing digital spatial information
for the Nation. Themes contain associated datasets (with attribute records and coordinates) that are
documented, verifiable, and officially designated to meet recognized standards. A theme contains one
or more datasets of geographic information from which other datasets can be derived. One of the
themes listed in OMB Circular A-16 pertains to Governmental Units.
Paragraph 8.d. of OMB Circular No. A-16 Revised, dated August 19, 2002, directs the development of a
strategic plan for each theme:
(2) Provide leadership and facilitate the development and implementation of a plan for
nationwide population of each data theme. Plans will include the development of
partnership programs with states, tribes, academia, the private sector, other federal
agencies, and localities that meet the needs of users, address human and financial
resource needs, identify needs for standards, metadata, and the Clearinghouse, and
advance a timetable for the development of National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)
data themes.5
The purpose of the following Strategic Plan is to present the activities associated with the Governmental
Units Theme in addition to noting opportunities and challenges in managing the theme. Specific
boundaries included in this theme:
“…delineate geographic areas for uses such as governance and the general provision of services
(e.g., states, American Indian reservations, counties, cities, towns, etc.), administration and/or
for a specific purpose (e.g., congressional districts, school districts, fire districts, Alaska Native
Regional Corporations, etc.), and/or provision of statistical data (census tracts, census blocks,
metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas, etc.) … Other boundaries may include
international limits, those of federal land ownership, the extent of administrative regions for
various federal agencies, as well as the jurisdictional offshore limits of U.S. sovereignty.”6
The primary means to define these boundaries are “through a documented legal description or through
criteria and guidelines.”7 The following is a description of the types of geographic areas considered in
the Strategic plan:

It is important to note that the management of the Governmental Units, and Administrative and
Statistical Boundaries Theme is an interagency effort. All agencies that contribute to the theme’s assets
share responsibility to meet the goals, objectives, and actions outlined below for theme management.
Overall, the goals and objectives of the Governmental Units Theme plan provide data that is:
• Current (how is it defined by responsible agency)
• Accurate (what is required by responsible agency)
• Consistent (Between agencies)
• Accessible (To federal agencies and the public where possible)
• Integrated (Ability to use each other’s data without duplication)
Program schedules for census operations involving boundary updates are included in Appendix 1.
