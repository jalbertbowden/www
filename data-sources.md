## BREAK
Streams & Water Bodies – Hydrographic features were obtained from the USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). The National Hydrography Dataset is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that contains information about surface water features such as lakes, ponds, streams, rivers, springs and wells. Within the NHD, surface water features are combined to form "reaches," which provide the framework for linking water-related data to the NHD surface water drainage network. NHD data is provided at four resolutions: Local, High, Medium, and Low. The high resolution data was utilized and downloaded from [ftp://nhdftp.usgs.gov/SubRegions](ftp://nhdftp.usgs.gov/SubRegions). The data is provided based upon Hydrologic Unit Component (HUC) level 4 watersheds.  

• Electric Transmission & Fuel Pipelines – transmission line and pipeline information was extracted from USGS Digital Line Graph (DLG) datasets for Colorado. A Digital Line Graph (DLG) is digital vector data representing cartographic information. DLGs contain a wide variety of information depicting geographic features. DLGs are derived from hypsographic data (contour lines) using USGS 7.5-minute, 15-minute, 2-arc-second (30- by 60-minute), and 1:2 million-scale topographic quadrangle maps. The spatial accuracy of the transmission line data was coarse (1:100,000 scale) and was out of data in some cases. Aerial photography and field visits were used to verify and/or correct above ground features where available. Additional DLG information is available at [http://rockyweb.cr.usgs.gov/nmpstds/dlgstds.html](http://rockyweb.cr.usgs.gov/nmpstds/dlgstds.html).  

• Physical & Cultural Feature Names – The U.S. Board on Geographic Names is a Federal body created in 1890 and established in its present form by Public Law in 1947 to maintain uniform geographic name usage throughout the Federal Government. The USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) is the Federal standard for geographic nomenclature. The GNIS contains information about physical and cultural geographic features of all types in the United States. The database holds the federally recognized name of each feature and defines the feature location by state, county, USGS topographic map, and geographic coordinates. Other attributes include names or spellings other than the official name, feature designations, feature classification, historical and descriptive information, and for some categories the geometric boundaries. The data utilized was downloaded as point features and included names of towns, historic features, etc. More information on the GNIS can be found at [http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/index.html](http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/index.html).  

• Railroads – Current rail network and existing grade crossing data was obtained from the Bureau for Transportation Statistics (BTS). The rail network is a comprehensive database of the nation's railway system at the 1:100,000 scale. The data set covers all 50 States plus the District of Columbia. FRA Grade Crossings are a spatial file that originates from the National Highway-Rail Crossing Inventory Program. The program is structured to provide information to Federal, State, and local governments as well as the railroad industry for the improvements of safety at highway-rail crossing. More information for the railroad data utilized can be found at http://www.bts.gov/programs/geographic_information_services.  

• 2005 1-Meter Resolution Aerial Photography – The National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP) acquires digital ortho imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of ortho imagery within one year of acquisition. NAIP provides two main products: 1 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho imagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy of within +/- 3 meters of reference  Colorado Rail Relocation Implementation Study Appendix 3-3 digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ's) from the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP); and, 2 meter GSD ortho imagery rectified to within +/- 10 meters of reference DOQQs. For the purposes of R2C2, aerial photography was obtained at 1-meter resolution as MrSID format images for the counties encountered through the corridor. More information on NAIP imagery can be found at [http://www.apfo.usda.gov/NAIP.html](http://www.apfo.usda.gov/NAIP.html).

• Public Lands Survey System (PLSS) Townships, Ranges, Sections, & QQ Sections – Township, range, section, and QQ section data were obtained from the BLM’s Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB). The locations of PLSS corners, as represented in geographic coordinate pairs, were derived from a variety of source documents, which include U.S. General Land Office and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) survey plats/notes, as well as survey data obtained from other U.S. Government agencies, private sector survey firms, and local governments. Property parcel boundaries for Fort Morgan and Adams counties were defined by referencing on-line internet map servers against PLSS data through the corridors. Jurisdictional boundaries were also extracted from data provided by the BLM, allowing the definition of ownership for state and federal agency lands.

• Roads & Highways – Road information was utilized from ESRI StreetMap USA data bundled with ArcGIS 9.2. This data provided street centerlines for all knows streets through the study area. This includes all interstates, state highways, arterials, collectors, local, and private streets. Additional information regarding ESRI’s StreetMap data products can be found at [http://www.esri.com/data/streetmap/index.html](http://www.esri.com/data/streetmap/index.html).
