## [The WebKitGTK Project](https://webkitgtk.org/)  
**WebKitGTK** is a full-featured port of the WebKit rendering engine, suitable for projects requiring any kind of web integration, from hybrid HTML/CSS applications to full-fledged web browsers. It offers WebKit’s full functionality and is useful in a wide range of systems from desktop computers to embedded systems like phones, tablets, and televisions. WebKitGTK is made by a lively community of developers and designers, who hope to bring the web platform to everyone. It’s the official web engine of the GNOME platform and is used in browsers such as [Epiphany](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Web) ([original Epiphany](http://web.archive.org/web/20120204144359/http://projects.gnome.org/epiphany/)) and [Midori](http://www.twotoasts.de/index.php/midori/).
