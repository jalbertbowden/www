Typography: Roman numerals

Counting is nothing but stringing together, whereby the quantity, depending on the system, is bundled in a certain sequence. In our current Arabic or decimal system, there are tens of bundles, while in the Roman system they were five bundles. Each next higher bundle was displayed with a new writing position. That is, in the decimal system, the values ​​zero to nine are single digits, ten to ninety-nine digits, hundred to nine hundred and ninety-three digits, and so on. The first passage from the right shows the one, the second the ten, the third the hundreds, and the fourth the thousand.

The Roman system proceeds in the same way, just as I said, in five units. The quantity was first shown in dashes, the fifth uniting the unit diagonally along four vertical lines. The result was a V, which was always written in the same way. Thus one could juxtapose four four, four tens, four hundred, but no more. The fifth sign was always different, one that marked the next higher rank. Up to four you could make strokes IIII. The fifth sign was the bundling, ie V. Four lines were added to the V. VIIII. The next sign represented two bundles, one mirrored to the other as X. In this way one could count up to forty-nine, without a new sign being necessary. Until then the single series, five bundles, and double or ten bundles were sufficient. The next sign consisted of a different kind:

The alphabet also had an angular-like character, though not of the same dimension: L. With it one could now write to ninety-nine. 

Here, if you will, a break occurs. From that point onwards, no counting symbols are used, but nominal symbols. These are the initial letters of numbers, namely C for centum (one hundred), M for mill (one thousand). D was for dimidius, which means the middle or half, which in this case meant five hundred.

Only when in Europe the so-called Arabic numerals became generally known (around 1200) did the custom come to write instead of the four only three more like signs. The simple counting of the values ​​was no longer possible, it had now to be deducted. The characters were no longer grouped from right to left, but the larger value was always on the left, but were written through each other in the sense that a smaller value, which was deducted from the larger one, was also possible to the left of the larger one. In the case of four, no four strokes were counted, but one of five (V) was subtracted (IV).

It should be noted that one could only be deducted from hundreds and tens, tens of hundreds and hundreds by thousands. Ninety-nine could not be written with one hundred (C) minus one (IC), but only one hundred minus ten (XC) and ten minus one (IX), which was summarized as: XCIX 

I 1 
V 5 
X 10 
L 50 
C 100 
D 500 
M 1000
