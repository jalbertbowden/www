"FIPS codes numbered 5-2 and 6-4 were originally published in the 1970s (as previous versions 5-1 and 6-3) and then updated in 1987 and 1990 respectively. FIPS 5-2 issued a 2-digit numeric value for each U.S. state, the District of Columbia, outlying territories and other affiliated areas. This series also includes the 2-letter state abbreviations – introduced previously by the U.S. Postal Service with the development of the 5-digit ZIP code in 1963. FIPS 6-4 issued a 3-digit numeric value identifying counties and equivalent subdivisions. Combined these 5-digits provide a unique state/county identifier. In 2008 these two sets were dropped (among other geographic area codes) from NIST authority, but still continue to be used by the U.S. Census Bureau. The new replacement standard for the state code (FIPS 5-2) is INCITS 38 – 2009, and for the county code (FIPS 6-4), INCITS 31 – 2009. These INCITS (InterNational Committee for Information Technology Standards) codes are standards which operate under the management of American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The Census now uses these updated ANSI codes; however the FIPS acronym still remains in use, though with a slightly altered meaning (Federal Information Processing Series)."
