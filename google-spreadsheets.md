Exploratory data analysis and regression modeling for Google spreadsheets.  

Statistics is a package for doing statistical analysis in Google spreadsheets.  Statistics is a point-and-click analysis tool that gets you the most analysis out of the fewest clicks.  

The Statistics add-on is brought to you by Google engineers and statisticians.  It accesses data in Google Sheets, analyzes it in Google data-centers and displays results in a new sheet.  Your data live securely within the Google ecosystem.  

The Statistics add-on provides statistics and data analysis functionality to Google Sheets. It is designed to get you a full statistical analysis of your data with very few clicks. You don't make a histogram, then make a boxplot, then compute the mean and standard deviation. Instead, you select the variables you want to analyze, and do the analysis all at once.

The Statistics add-on enables:  
    Summarize a single variable  
    Summarize the relationships between pairs of variables  
    Fit (and critique) a regression model.
