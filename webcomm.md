[OSM go](http://www.osmgo.org/)  
OSM go is a 3D rendered of OSM data.  
[OSM go Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_go)  
The intention of OSM go is to motivate new people to use OpenStreetMap as a useful, every day tool. But also to become a contributor and improve the database. The idea was born with the hype of Pok√©mon GO: if the kids start to run around in the town, why not make them do something useful? Whether the idea is nicked by Pokemon, anyone may note. There are quite a few ideas for gamification and much to do yet. Some are the same as in [Kort Game Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Kort_Game)/[Kort Game](http://www.kort.ch/) and [Kort Repository](https://github.com/kort).
